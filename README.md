# LumpeREDUX
Forked by matchiiii, originally created by [Lumpooni](https://github.com/Lumpooni/Lumepemon2.0)

_LumpeREDUX_ is a modpack made for Minecraft: Java Edition created for use with the Lumpemon 2.0 server,
and was forked from the main Lumpemon 2.0 Modpack in order to add further QOL and preformance-enhancing mods
for the added benefit to the end-user.

Updates will be provided whenever needed, and will come in the form of smaller archives 
containing only the new mods. This is a temporary measure untilI figure out how to make 
a dedicated downloader & auto-updater.

### Prerequisites for use
Before using this modpack, you must ensure your launcher wheter the Official or a Custom launcher,
you need to have a Forge 1.20.1 instance before starting it, or else the modpack will not function!
